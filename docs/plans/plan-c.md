# C Programming Plan

## Goals

- Master C fundamentals
- Write efficient, clean, system-level C programs
- Understand memory deeply (stack, heap, pointers)
- Prepare for Linux system and kernel programming

---

## Topics to Cover

### Phase 1: Basics (Month 1)

- Setting up Environment (gcc, make)
- Variables and Data Types
- Input/Output (printf, scanf)
- Operators and Expressions
- Control Flow (if-else, switch-case, loops)
- Functions and Recursion Basics

### Phase 2: Pointers and Memory (Month 2)

- Introduction to Pointers
- Pointer Arithmetic
- Arrays and Pointers
- Strings and Pointers
- Dynamic Memory Allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc, free)
- Structures and Unions
- Enums and Typedef

### Phase 3: Intermediate Concepts (Month 3)

- File Handling (fopen, fread, fwrite, fclose)
- Command Line Arguments (argc, argv)
- Preprocessor Directives (#define, #include, #ifdef)
- Modular Programming (splitting code into .c and .h files)
- Storage Classes (auto, extern, static, register)

### Phase 4: Advanced C (Month 4)

- Bitwise Operators and Bit Manipulation
- Linked Lists (Single, Double)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Basic Introduction)
- Memory Management Deep Dive (Common Mistakes)

### Phase 5: C for Systems Programming (Month 5)

- Process Creation (fork, exec)
- Signals and Signal Handling
- Inter-Process Communication (pipes, message queues, shared memory)
- File Descriptors and System Calls
- Error Handling (errno)

---

## Practical Deliverables

- 30+ C Programs (basic to advanced)
- 5 Mini Projects (file explorer, text-based game, memory manager simulator, etc.)
- Well-commented and modular code
- Notes on each major concept

---

## Resources

- "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie
- "Understanding and Using C Pointers" by Richard Reese
- Linux Man Pages (`man 2 fork`, `man 2 exec`, etc.)
- Online practice sites (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank C tracks)

---

## Notes

- Focus more on writing clean and readable code.
- Always manage memory properly (malloc/free).
- Test every piece of code with corner cases.
- Document important learnings and mistakes.
