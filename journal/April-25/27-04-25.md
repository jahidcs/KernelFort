# üìì Journal Entry: Lesson 1 - Getting Started with C

**Date:** 2025-04-27
**Lesson:** C Programming - Chapter 1.1 ("The C Programming Language" by Kernighan & Ritchie)

---

## Reflections:

Today, I officially started my C programming journey using the legendary K&R book.

I learned about:

- What C is and why it matters.
- How simple yet powerful C is when it comes to controlling the machine.
- How to write, compile, and run my first C program: the classic `"hello, world"`.
- The importance of precision: semicolons, case-sensitivity, syntax discipline.

I modified the "hello, world" program to print my own custom message, and it gave me a little taste of how satisfying coding close to the machine can be.

---

## Key Takeaways:

- C gives **full control** over the system, unlike high-level languages that hide details.
- The **main()** function is where the program execution starts.
- `#include <stdio.h>` is necessary for input/output.
- Compilation with `gcc` is simple but powerful ‚Äî it converts human-readable code into machine-executable files.

---

## Personal Notes:

- Writing the first C program felt nostalgic and exciting.
- I can already feel the difference in "power" compared to writing in Python or Dart.
- The compiler treats me like an adult: no hand-holding, full responsibility.
- I am motivated to go deeper.
