# 📓 Journal Entry: Lesson 3 - The For Loop

**Date:** 2025-04-29  
**Lesson:** C Programming - Chapter 1.3 (The For Statement)

---

## Reflections:

Today I explored the `for` loop in C — a fundamental construct for iteration. It reminded me of how much control C offers over the flow of a program. Unlike Python or Dart, where loops are expressive and abstracted, C requires everything to be explicitly defined: initialization, condition, and increment.

The clarity of the `for` loop’s structure really clicked for me. I appreciated how predictable and powerful it is. I practiced printing sequences, counting up and down, even generating square numbers. It's basic yet empowering.

## Key Takeaways:

- `for` loops in C give precise control over iteration.
- Each part of the loop — init, condition, increment — is independent.
- Nesting `for` loops is useful for matrix or table-style outputs.
- Compared to high-level languages, C’s approach feels low-level but transparent.

---

## Personal Notes:

- I feel like I'm training myself to think in loops again, but with more intention.
- These simple loops open the path to many patterns I’ll use later in system programming.
- I’m already imagining how this will translate to tasks like polling a device or managing buffers.

# 📅 Next Session Plan

**Topic:** Symbolic Constants & Character I/O (K&R 1.4 and 1.5)

**Outline:**

- Learn to define symbolic constants with `#define`.
- Explore character-level input/output using `getchar()` and `putchar()`.

**Goal:**

- Understand constant values in C.
- Practice reading and writing characters manually — keyboard and screen level.

**Assignment Preview:**

- Write a program to echo characters typed by the user.
- Define and use a symbolic constant for a conversion formula (e.g., temperature conversion).
