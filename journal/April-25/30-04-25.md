# 📓 Journal Entry: Lesson 4 – For Loops, Symbolic Constants & Temperature Conversion

**Date:** 2025-04-30
**Lesson:** K&R Chapter 1.4 – 1.5

---

## Reflections:

Today was a heavier day of learning, but also incredibly enlightening. I explored:

- How `for` loops provide concise iteration.
- The power and purpose of symbolic constants via `#define`.
- Writing a complete temperature conversion table using a clean loop.

Initially, it felt complex, but breaking it down helped me understand how looping logic, symbolic constants, and arithmetic expressions come together to form robust, readable code.

---

## Key Takeaways:

- `for` loops are ideal for scenarios with a known start/end.
- `#define` lets you assign meaningful names to values, improving clarity and maintainability.
- Expressions inside loops (like `fahr = 5 * (celsius - 32) / 9`) must be carefully structured, as integer division can cause unexpected results.
- Keeping logic tidy using symbolic constants and loop control makes a program easier to adapt later.

---

## Personal Notes:

- I experimented with changing the step and range in the loop, which helped reinforce how loop conditions work.
- The symbolic constants felt like a first taste of "configurable code" — small but meaningful abstraction.
- This is my first time writing a full C program that performs meaningful work. It feels empowering.

---

## 🧠 Concepts I Found Tricky:

- Integer division (e.g., 5/9 = 0). I now understand why casting or using floats is essential in some places.
- The structure of the `for` loop — it looks compact but holds a lot. Dissecting it line-by-line helped.

## 📅 Next Session Plan

**Topic:** K&R 1.6 – Loops and While

**Outline:**

- Introduction to `while` loops.
- Difference between `while`, `for`, and `do-while`.
- Create a reverse temperature conversion table using a `while` loop.

**Goal:**

- Understand and be able to apply `while` loops.
- Get comfortable choosing the right loop construct for the task.

**Assignment Preview:**

- Write a temperature conversion table using `while` instead of `for`.
- Modify step size and starting point to build deeper understanding.
