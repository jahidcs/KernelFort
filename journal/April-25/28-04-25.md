# üìì Journal Entry: Lesson 2 - Variables and Arithmetic Expressions

**Date:** 2025-04-28  
**Lesson:** C Programming - Chapter 1.2 ("The C Programming Language" by Kernighan & Ritchie)

---

## Reflections:

Today's lesson dived into one of the building blocks of any program: **Variables** and **Arithmetic Expressions**.

I learned about:

- How to declare variables of different types (int, float).
- How to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
- How integer division differs from floating-point division.
- Using `printf()` effectively to format output.

I also wrote small programs to solidify these concepts ‚Äî a basic calculator and a temperature converter from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Even though these are simple concepts, I realized how important they are for writing more complex programs later.

## Key Takeaways:

- **Variables must be declared before use** ‚Äî and the data type matters.
- **Integer division truncates** the decimal part. Always cast or use floats if you need accurate division.
- **Format specifiers** in `printf()` are essential:
  - `%d` for int
  - `%f` for float
- **Initialization** is a good practice: don't leave variables uninitialized.

---

## Personal Notes:

- Writing and running multiple small programs helped me gain more confidence.
- Remembering format specifiers will become second nature over time.
- C is strict but logical ‚Äî if I think like the machine, I can code better.
- I enjoyed creating small, real-world conversions (temperature) instead of just random numbers.

# üìÖ Next Session Plan

**Topic:** The For Loop (K&R 1.3)

**Outline:**

- Learn about `for` loops in C.
- Understand syntax and flow.
- Write programs using loops for repetitive tasks (e.g., print tables, patterns).
- Dive into how initialization, condition, and increment parts work inside the `for` loop.

**Goal:**

- Be comfortable writing basic `for` loops.
- Understand where loops are useful.

**Assignment Preview:**

- Write a program to print Celsius to Fahrenheit table.
- Write a program that prints squares of numbers from 1 to 10.
