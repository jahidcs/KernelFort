# 📓 Journal Entry: Lesson 6 - Symbolic Constants with `#define`

**Date:** 2025-04-30
**Lesson:** C Programming - Chapter 1.7 (K\&R)

---

## ✍️ Reflections:

Today’s lesson showed me how a simple thing like defining constants with `#define` can make code so much more readable and powerful.

It really clicked why hardcoding values like 0, 300, or 20 in multiple places can be dangerous. Just replacing them with symbolic names like `LOWER`, `UPPER`, and `STEP` makes the logic crystal clear.

The compiler doesn't care if I hardcode numbers — but as a human writing and maintaining the code, it makes all the difference.

## 💡 Key Takeaways:

- `#define` is a preprocessor directive that replaces symbolic names with values before compilation.
- It makes code easier to change and maintain.
- Avoiding "magic numbers" improves clarity and prevents bugs from inconsistent updates.
- This is especially useful in cases where values like ranges or limits appear multiple times in code.

---

## 🧪 Practice Summary:

- Rewrote the Fahrenheit-to-Celsius table using symbolic constants.
- Modified the code easily by changing the values of `LOWER`, `UPPER`, and `STEP` — no need to touch the logic.
- Practiced defining a constant for PI and calculated the area of a circle.

## 📚 Personal Notes:

- I’m seeing how even small conventions in C reflect big software engineering principles.
- This chapter was easy to understand, but it reinforced a best practice I’ll use in every language I work with.
- I appreciate how the K\&R book layers complexity little by little while grounding everything in working code.

## 📅 Next Session Plan

**Topic:** Character Input and Output (K\&R 1.8 & 1.9)

**Outline:**

- Understand how to read input using `getchar()`
- Learn to print output with `putchar()`
- Write a program that echoes characters until EOF
- Observe how input/output work at a low level

**Goal:**

- Grasp character-level I/O and its importance in system-level programs

**Assignment Preview:**

- Implement a basic version of the UNIX `cat` command that echoes user input.
