# üìì Journal Entry: Lesson 5 ‚Äì While Loops in C

**Date:** 2025-05-04  
**Lesson:** C Programming - Chapter 1.5 ("The C Programming Language" by Kernighan & Ritchie)  
**Topic:** While Loops and Repetition Control

---

## Reflections:

Today I studied how to use the `while` loop in C. I now understand how it provides a flexible way to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.

I practiced writing loops for temperature conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius, printing sequences of numbers, and counting loops using increment logic. The emphasis on control flow and condition evaluation gave me insight into how loops behave at a lower level.

---

## Key Takeaways:

- The `while` loop checks the condition before executing the block.
- Loop variables need to be initialized before the loop starts.
- If the condition is false on the first check, the loop block won't run.
- Looping is essential for many real-world problems ‚Äî from iteration to automation.
- Mistakes like infinite loops happen if we forget to update loop variables.

---

## Personal Notes:

- I now feel more confident with writing loops in C.
- I learned to always double-check my loop conditions to prevent infinite loops.
- I enjoy the structured way C handles control flow ‚Äî it's logical and minimal.
- The K&R examples are compact, but understanding each line deeply takes effort.

# üìÖ Next Session Plan

**Topic:** K&R 1.6 ‚Äì Symbolic Constants (More Depth) and Loop Enhancements

**Outline:**

- Understand when to use symbolic constants vs. hard-coded values
- Practice loop refactoring using constants
- Introduce `#define` usage patterns
- Explore loop variable declarations inside `for`

**Goal:**

- Become fluent in using symbolic constants to write cleaner, more maintainable code.

**Assignment Preview:**

- Revisit previous loop programs and rewrite them using `#define` constants for limits and steps.
- Try creating a simple CLI menu that loops until the user exits.
