# KernelFort

A year-long journey to learn C, C++, Bash scripting, Assembly, Linux internals, kernel development, and system programming.

## About

KernelFort is my personal project where I practice and document everything I learn about the core of system programming.  
The goal is to build a strong foundation in C, C++, Linux internals, Bash scripting, device drivers, kernel modules, and basic OS development.

I believe understanding the low-level side of computing makes you a better software engineer.

## 1-Year Learning Plan

### Phase 1: C Programming, Bash & Linux Basics (Months 1‚Äì3)
- Learn C deeply (pointers, memory management, file I/O)
- Start writing Bash scripts for automation
- Explore Linux basics and command-line

### Phase 2: Linux Internals, System Programming, C++ Basics (Months 4‚Äì6)
- Understand processes, system calls, signals, memory management
- Build small utilities in C and C++
- Learn debugging tools (gdb, valgrind, strace)

### Phase 3: Kernel Modules, Assembly & Deep Linux (Months 7‚Äì9)
- Write simple Linux kernel modules
- Explore kernel-space vs user-space
- Learn Assembly language (x86, ARM)

### Phase 4: OS Development & Advanced Projects (Months 10‚Äì12)
- Write a basic bootloader
- Build a minimal operating system
- Explore contributing to Linux kernel or open-source system projects
