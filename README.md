# KernelFort 🏰  
**My personal journey learning C, Linux kernel, and low-level programming.**  

## **What’s Here?**  
- 📚 **C Basics**: Solutions to K&R exercises, small programs.  
- 🐧 **Linux Experiments**: System calls, kernel module examples.  
- 🔧 **Projects**: Custom tools (e.g., tiny shell, memory allocator).  

## **Current Goal**  
- **Project**: Writing a Linux character driver.  
- **Progress**: `[ ]` Started | `[✔]` Finished  

## **Why Public?**
