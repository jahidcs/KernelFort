# KernelFort

A year-long journey to learn C programming, Linux internals, kernel development, and low-level system programming.

---

## About

KernelFort is my personal project where I practice and document everything I learn about the core of system programming.  
The goal is to build a strong foundation in C, Linux internals, device drivers, kernel modules, and basic OS development.

I believe understanding the low-level side of computing makes you a better software engineer.

## 1-Year Learning Plan

### Phase 1: C Programming & Linux Basics (Months 1‚Äì3)
- Learn C deeply (pointers, memory management, structures, file I/O)
- Build small programs and command-line tools
- Explore Linux terminal basics

### Phase 2: Linux Internals & System Programming (Months 4‚Äì6)
- Understand processes, system calls, signals, and memory management
- Write simple Linux utilities
- Learn debugging tools (gdb, valgrind, strace)

### Phase 3: Kernel Modules & Assembly Basics (Months 7‚Äì9)
- Write simple Linux kernel modules
- Explore kernel-space vs user-space
- Start learning x86/ARM Assembly basics

### Phase 4: OS Development & Advanced Concepts (Months 10‚Äì12)
- Write a simple bootloader
- Understand the basics of OS design
- Try contributing to Linux kernel or related open-source projects
